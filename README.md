# SALT-RSS-FP-pipeline
A Fabry-Perot data reduction pipeline for the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) at the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) written in IDL.

Note that this pipeline was written before the release of the official RSS Fabry-Perot pipeline included in the PySALT package (https://pysalt.salt.ac.za/) and is for demonstration purposes only. SALT users should refer to the official SALT documentation for guidence on data reduction.

This package makes use of the bclean function from the Figaro data reduction package, found in the Starlink astronomy software package (http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/starlink). This pipeline also requires functions from the IDL Astronomy User's Library (https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and the Coyote graphics library (http://www.idlcoyote.com/index.html).
